# UnblockedGPT

*[ BETA ] An unblocked version of ChatGPT built using Scratch and Turbowarp. Based off of GPT-3.5.*

**IMPORTANT NOTES:** 

There should be no reason to fork this project, unless the very rare case occurs that the [official UnblockedGPT link](https://sites.google.com/view/unblockedgpt/home?) gets blocked at your school/orginization. If this happens, you can fork this project by following the instructions below. Just note, you will need a web proxy to use your fork. I recommend [Ultraviolet](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet-App) or [Nebula.](https://github.com/NebulaServices/Nebula) (Both by [Titanium Network](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev)). Now you may be asking "If we have a proxy, why not just use the official ChatGPT website?" The official website detects if your using a proxy or not, blocking access to ChatGPT. UnblockedGPT lets you bypass this.
